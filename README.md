# Hi there 👋, I'm Anastasia

I'm a Data Scientist with experience across NLP, Computer Vision, traditional ML and DL, as well as advanced analytics.  
I love turning complex data into actionable insights and building models that make a real impact.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Languages & Tools:** Python, SQL, AWS, Jenkins, Docker, Excel, SPSS, Tableau, PowerBI
- **Libraries:** pandas, polars, NumPy, scikit-learn, imbalanced-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, TensorFlow, PyTorch, Optuna

## 📌 Projects & Highlights
- [End-to-End Hotel Reservation Prediction](https://github.com/AnastasiaRassi/End-to-End Hotel-Reservation-Prediction): Production-ready machine learning system for predicting hotel booking cancellations. Built a full pipeline including data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training and evaluation, and an interactive web interface for real-time predictions. Implemented CI/CD for automated testing and deployment, and deployed the application on AWS to support scalable, reliable inference.
- [Forecasting Monthly Flight Delay](https://github.com/AnastasiaRassi/Forecasting-Flight-Delays-Monthly): Monthly flight delay forecasting using EDA, statistical analysis, feature engineering and regression modelling.
- [Arabic NLP Pipeline](https://github.com/AnastasiaRassi/NLP_Pipeline_Arabic): Production NER and sentiment analysis pipeline for Arabic text.
- [End-to-End Financial Fraud Detection](https://github.com/AnastasiaRassi/Financial_Fraud_Detection): End-to-end ML pipeline with experiment tracking and testing.
- [Image Classification Papers](https://github.com/AnastasiaRassi/Image-Recognition-Models): Replicating research papers in Computer Vision: SqueezeNet and ResNet.
